This is a simple example of using scalatra with scalate.
It uses sbt to build but you can also run:

sbt make-pom && mvn package if you want to use maven.

This is meant to accompany the tutorial at http://code.chengin.com/ScalatraScalate.html

To build and run this example:

git clone git://github.com/h3adache/scalatrascalate.git
cd scalatrascalate
sbt
# while inside sbt
> update
> jetty-run

browse to http://localhost:8080 to see the results.
